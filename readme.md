## Hello, Git.

I'm adding this from "feature-branch"


Push a remote branch upstream.
git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME
or 
git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME

Push changes after a branch is established.
git push


Typical workflow to follow when working on a team with Git.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch from the main branch or another branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Push the branch to the remote repository.
5. Open up a pull request. 
6. Merge the changes.
7. Pull the marged changes into your local main branch.
8. Repeat from step 2.
